            <h2>Wilfred Banda</h2>
            <p>
                I'm in my final year of Computer Science at the University of the Witwatersrand, and I’m passionate about using data to generate meaningful predictions—especially in finance. This interest has sparked my curiosity in data-driven roles like quantitative analysis, data engineering, and software development in the financial world.
                My ultimate goal is to become a quantitative trader, and I’m excited to document the journey as I pick up the skills and experience along the way.
                When I’m not deep in code or exploring financial markets, you’ll probably find me day trading, gaming (I swear no one can beat me in FIFA—though maybe that says more about my confidence than my skills!), or just relaxing with friends and family.
                Looking forward to what’s ahead!
            </p>
